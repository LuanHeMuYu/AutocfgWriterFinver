# AutocfgWriterFinver
This is L4D2's tools.Usually use in Zonemod etc... It can help you to write your own cfg easily.In past,i wrote it in Java,but swing can't run in some player's computer who hasn't JVM ,otherwish i use in Java17 not Java8.So i decide use .Net to finish this Project.Thanks you to read this text,see you in that day when i finish it :D
